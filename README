rixi is a mixi graph api's wrapper class in Ruby.
rixi heavily inspired by "tumblife for ruby" and "rubytter".

Example:
Please read sample_*.rb.
In "sample_sinatra.rb", it's the toutrial for a sinatra application that use this wrapper,
and, in "sample_safari.rb", it's able to trial this tool in your local "irb".
"sample_safari.rb" needs a safariwatir rubygem and the safari browser.
